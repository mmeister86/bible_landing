        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to DailyVerse. This Privacy Policy explains how DailyVerse
          ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your
          information when you use the DailyVerse mobile application (the
          "App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to the
          practices described in this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This policy applies to all users of the DailyVerse App, available on
          the Apple App Store. We are committed to protecting your privacy and
          handling your data transparently.

      <!-- 2. Information We Collect -->
      <section id="information-we-collect">
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          If you create an account, we collect your <strong>email address</strong>
          for account registration, authentication, and communication purposes.
          Account creation is optional; the App can be used without an account.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect limited usage data, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>App usage statistics (e.g., features used, session duration)</li>
          <li>Device type and model</li>
          <li>Operating system and version</li>
          <li>App version</li>
          <li>General interaction patterns to help us improve the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Financial Information</h3>
        <p>
          We do <strong>not</strong> collect any financial or payment
          information. All purchases, if applicable, are processed entirely
          through the Apple App Store, and we do not have access to your payment
          details.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Bible Reading Preferences &amp; Saved Verses</h3>
        <p>
          Your Bible reading preferences, bookmarks, highlights, and saved
          verses are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. This data
          is not transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly choose to sync
          it via an account.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. How We Use Your Information -->
      <section id="how-we-use-your-information">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Provide and maintain the service</strong> — delivering daily
            Bible verses, managing your account, and enabling core App features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Send daily verse notifications</strong> — delivering your
            scheduled Bible verse reminders via push notifications, which you
            can enable or disable at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improve the App</strong> — analyzing aggregated usage data
            to understand how features are used, fix bugs, and develop new
            functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communicate with you</strong> — responding to support
            requests and sending important service updates.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third
          parties for marketing purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 4. Data Storage & Security -->
      <section id="data-storage-and-security">
        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to keeping your data secure. Our approach to data
          storage is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Local storage:</strong> Verse favorites, bookmarks,
            highlights, and reading preferences are stored locally on your
            device. This data remains under your control and is not
            automatically uploaded to external servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Server-side data:</strong> If you create an account, your
            email address and basic account information are stored on secure
            servers. We minimize the amount of data stored server-side.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security measures:</strong> We use industry-standard
            security practices, including encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and
            secure server infrastructure, to protect any data transmitted to or
            stored on our servers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no
          method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot
          guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

      <!-- 5. Third-Party Services -->
      <section id="third-party-services">
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The App uses the following third-party services, each of which has its
          own privacy policy governing the use of your information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase Analytics (Google)</strong> — We use Firebase
            Analytics to collect anonymized, aggregated usage statistics. This
            helps us understand how users interact with the App and identify
            areas for improvement. Firebase may collect device identifiers and
            usage data. See
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple Analytics</strong> — We may receive anonymized app
            analytics data provided by Apple, including crash reports and usage
            statistics, in accordance with Apple's privacy practices. See
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)</strong> — We use
            APNs to deliver daily verse notifications. Apple processes
            notification delivery through its own infrastructure. No personal
            message content is shared with Apple beyond what is necessary to
            deliver the notification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party
          services to understand their data practices.
